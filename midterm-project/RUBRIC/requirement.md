# Market Profile Analysis and ML Feasibility Tool

### **Overview**

The project focuses on developing a **Market Profile Analysis and Machine Learning (ML) Feasibility Tool** that helps traders identify, visualize, and forecast key value areas in financial markets. It combines **Market Profile theory** (which shows how price and time form market value zones) with **machine learning models** to predict market behavior.

### **Objectives**

* Build a platform to visualize Market Profile using historical price–volume data.
* Apply ML models to detect accumulation/distribution phases and forecast market shifts.
* Provide insights like breakout probability and value area changes.
* Enable future integration with real-time trading data.

### **Core Features**

* Generate and visualize Market Profile (POC, VAH, VAL).
* Detect market balance and imbalance states.
* Implement ML modules for forecasting and pattern recognition.
* Display results through an interactive dashboard.

### **Machine Learning Feasibility**

ML models can use structured OHLCV data to forecast shifts and detect market phases.

* **Models:** LSTM, XGBoost, K-means, CNN.
* **Approach:** Start with supervised learning, then expand to advanced methods.

### **Tech Stack**

* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch
* **Visualization:** Dash / Streamlit
* **APIs:** Yahoo Finance, Binance

### **Roadmap**

1. Build Market Profile generator.
2. Add ML forecasting models.
3. Integrate live data.
4. Extend to reinforcement learning.

### **Success Metrics**

* Forecast accuracy.
* Dashboard usability.
* Real-time performance.
* Scalability.

### **Future Enhancements**

* Use tick-level and Level 2 data.
* Add sentiment analysis (news/social media).
* Support multiple assets/exchanges.
